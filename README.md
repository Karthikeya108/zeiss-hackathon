## What it does

It makes cancer detection cheap and fast. Cancer detection already on a microscope. In case of uncertainity, the same blood/tissue sample can be checked again instead of waiting for a new blood/tissue sample.

## How I built it

Usage of Azure DLVM for Training. Deployment on a Smart Zeiss Microscope. Retrofit Solution with a Webservice based on Azure. Azure Machine Learning Services. Coffee and Love.

## Challenges I ran into

Usage of Azure Blob Storage for Training Data.
